InfoCloud
=========

InfoCloud is a platform that targets informatics teachers and students who want to perform
in this domain, assuring an attractive interface, easy to use and with multiple features.
By using this platform, organizing informatics contests becomes much easier, thanks to our
assessment tool, which allows uploading tests and assessing sources from students, as well
as generating a leaderboard after finishing a contest.

The best part of the InfoCloud platform is that it's scalable. It was written to run in Windows Azure,
Microsoft's cloud computing service, and the assessments are made on a number of 3 virtual machines
(but there could be many more, if the administrator of the platform affords it).

You can find out more in the documentation.
